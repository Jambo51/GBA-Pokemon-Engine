# GBA-Pokemon-Engine
Source code for Jambo51's Open Source GBA Pok√©mon Game Engine

This engine is being developed in my spare time by myself and only myself. As a result, progress has been slow.
Being open source, anyone is, of course, welcome to contribute to the engine, and I will attempt to assist in
understanding the code where possible.

Simply cloning this repo will not yield a compilable engine, however. There are a number of steps you must
undertake before you will be able to compile this.
